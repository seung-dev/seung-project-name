Kimchi that is readily made is called Gutjaree(겉절이) and the one that is fermented for a long time and has more sour taste is called Shin-Kimchi(신김치). Moreover, different regions of Korea make Kimchi in different ways with different kinds of ingredients. For instance the lower southern part tends to make it taste more salty to preserve it longer. Some of the extra ingredients they use include squids, oysters and various other raw seafoods. Kimchi is often cited for its health benefits and has been included in Health magazine's "World's Healthiest Foods".[8][9][10][11] Nonetheless, some research has found nitrate and salt levels in Kimchi to be possible risk factors to gastric cancer although shellfish and fruit consumption were found to be protective factors to gastric cancer. Research has also found kimchi to be a preventive factor to stomach cancer.[12][13][14]

In this case jeon, a dish made by seasoning whole, sliced, or minced fish, meat, vegetables, etc., and coating them with wheat flour and egg wash before frying them in oil,[17] can be considered a type of buchimgae.

An aehobak can be used to make both buchimgae and jeon:
